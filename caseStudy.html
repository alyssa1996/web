		<h5>#RIDEWITHFREITAG</h5>
		<p>We’re all about cycles at FREITAG – both the sustainability kind and the two-wheeled kind. 
		For the F-Crew, that means changing gear and biking to work, and for you, 
		it means being able to rent a bicycle backpack for free.</p>
		<h5>BlaBla</h5>
		<p>In this paper we analysed Freitag case study, a company established in Zurich, 
		since many years leader in the world in manufacturing and selling a wide range of fashionable bags made using recycled truck tarps. 
		Inspiring to sustainability, Freitag invented a really eccentric style and created a very successful branding. 
		Basing on this case study, the paper investigates the opportunity, even for recycled products, 
		to adopt successfully premium price policies focusing on the role assumed by marketing policies.</p>
